# Alternative ansible hosts file (aka inventory) for running Ansible on
# localhost. This is used when running Ansible inside Docker instead of
# using it as a Vagrant provisioner. The purpose of this is to set the Ansible
# role.

# This makes Ansible run role ubuntu-worker on localhost.
# Use ansible-playbook with options
# --inventory-file=docker-inventories/ubuntu-worker and
# additionally --connection=local to avoid using an ssh connection.
