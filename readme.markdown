CouchDB CI Setup
================

This is the repository for the automated creation of the CouchDB CI infrastructure. Well, at least it will be when it has grown up. This might take a while, though. Right now, it's just a bunch of Ansible scripts, a Vagrantfile and a Veewee definition.

See the readme files in folder `baseboxes` (for docs on building the base boxes) and in folder `vagrant` (for docs on how to spin up the setup locally).

Fair warning: This is very much work in progress.
